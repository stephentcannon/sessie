    <h1 id="title">SESSIE</h1>
      <p>Sessie is a simple and weird server side persistent session management package for Meteor.<br />
      Sessie creates, validates and manages sessions.<br />
      Loch is where Sessie stores persistent session data when you feed her.<br />
      Ness stores and tracks Collection items associated with a session.<br />
      Monster destroys Loch based session objects and Ness based collection items associated with a session.<br />
      Yes, Sessie as in Nessie. Loch aka Lake for storage. Ness as in that Irish Princess to take care of you and watch your shit for you. Monster cuz he wrecks your shit if you don't control him.</p>
      Your session id is: {{sessionId}}<br />
      Your session crypto key is: {{sessionKey}}<br />
      Your session expires on: {{sessionExpires}}<br />
      Your session expires in <b>{{sessionExpiry}}</b> days from your expiry date unless you visit again.<br />

          Add a Loch Item in the <a href="#feedsessie">Feed Sessie Loch Items</a> form. Use the <a href="#getitems">Get a Loch Item</a>. Change the Loch Item by submitting an existing Loch Item name with a different value in the <a href="#feedsessie">Feed Sessie Loch Items</a> form. Do it a few times. Use the delete icon in the <a href="#lochitems">Items in your Loch</a> table to delete session items. <b>Warning!</b> In this example demonstration, Sessie will add, update, delete, change mutability and change visibility of items every 30 seconds to demonstrate server side control of the session. See example.js for some ways you could use Sessie.

        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <div class="well">
          Sessie comes packaged inside this very example applicaton.  Inside of the example application you will see a /sessie/ sub-directory.  You will know you have the right sub-directory because there is a package.json file in it and three directories (server, client and lib).  Copy that sessie directory to your Meteor packages directory.  This will probably be at /usr/lib/meteor/packages.<br/>Then from your project directory type: <br />
          <code>meteor add sessie</code><br />
          Create a /client/config-sessie-client.js and a /server/config-sessie-server.js in your project and set your own configuration settings.  DO NOT use only <code>is_server</code> and <code>is_client</code> to protect your configuration settings.  Always use the /server/ and /client/ directories in your project for these configuration files.  Files not put in the /server/ directory will get pushed to the client and your configuration settings will be publicly visible even if they are surrouded by <code>is_server</code>.  Example files are included with the example application that comes with the Sessie project.

        <h2>Configuration: Set it and forget it!</h2>
        <div class="well">
          <p>You can use Sessie out of the box with the default settings or you can create your own custom settings.  See the example application example.js for an example implementation and /server/sessie-config-server.js and /client/sessie-config-client.js for basic configuation settings. Just set it and forget it!</p>
          <p>Example sessie-config-server.js</p>
          Set Sessie.expires in days.<br/>
          <code>Sessie.expires = 3;</code><br/>
          Change the crypto key Sessie.encryption_password, this encrypts the secret session key id and secret unique phrase to create the session crypto key.<br/>
          <code>Sessie.encryption_password = "mak3th1sd1ff1cult";</code><br/>
          Set the Sessie.session_key_timeout in minutes.  This is how often the session crypto keys are regenerated.<br />
          <code>Sessie.session_key_timeout = 60;</code><br />

          <p>Example sessie-config-client.js</p>
          Set the Sessie.cookie_prefix to your application or site.
          <code>Sessie.cookie_prefix = 'sessie'; </code><br/>
          Set the Sessie.cookie_seed to a unique id, function or environment variable.<br/>
          <code>Sessie.cookie_seed = navigator.userAgent;</code>

        <h2>The Session Id and Crypto Key</h2>
        <div class="well">
          The reason for both a session id and session crypto key is to provide more authentication and validation of sessions.  First by matching each element during requests against the server side session records.  Second, the session crypto key is a SHA512 hmac of a unique secret key id and secret unique phrase unknown to the client and validated and authenticated on each request.  Fourth, you can specify how the unique secret phrase is created by providing a unique id, a function to call or some kind of unique environment variable.  Fifth, the session key can be configured to regenerate based on a period of minutes that have passed.  All of this combined helps prevent counterfeit or fraudulent sessions and session hijacking.

          TODO do some as immutable and mutable and visibile and invisible<br />
          Control all your session variable server side. In example.js the server has a timer that will randomly create, update and delete variables on your client session every 30 seconds. The example will not add more than 9 Loch items, but you can add as many elements as you like.  It will delete and change any of them.  It will also change the mutability and visibility of them. This provides you with an example of how client sessions can be controlled server side. Imagine an administrative control panel to control the user experience, timed work flows, logic based work flows and anything else you might want to do.

          <p>Want your session's Loch data items to automatically be avialable as Meteor Session object data values? Then do absolutely nothing! Otherwise you have to turn it off when you create Loch data items.

        <h2>Mutable or immutable? That is the question!</h2>
        <div class="well">
          <p>In order to provide a modicum of security, by default all Loch items are immutable and the client cannot change them.  Server side you can do whatever you want to sessions and session variables.  Mutability must be explicitly set as TRUE when you set Loch items.  Mutability is controlled by passing an options object when setting a Loch item.
          <br /><code>{ mutable: false } //default</code><br />OR<br /><code>{ mutable:true }</code></p>
          In example.js the server has a timer that creates some immutable session variables and change some session variables to immutable.  You will not be able to change them or delete them.  Mutability can be set on the server and not the client but obviously server side is a more realistic solution.

        <h2>Visible or invisible? Houdini would be proud!</h2>
        <div class="well">
          TODO
          <p>Want to hold session variables but don't want them visible on the client?  No problem!  Set their visibility to false and they will not be published with the Loch collection.  You can still modify and alter them server and client side but they will not be visible client side.  Obviously, if you want to set or delete them client side and they are not visible you must already know their name.  The visible option can be used to hold Loch session data instead of deleting it.</p>
          <br /><code>{ visible: true } //default</code><br />OR<br /><code>{ visible:false }</code></p>
          In example.js the server has a timer that will update session variables and change their visibility from time to time.  So you may see session variables appear and disappear from time to time.  Visibility does not protect session variables, mutability does.

        <div class="well">
          TODO Out of the box, Sessie has semi-permanent session lifetimes based on session configuration parameters you control. Basically, if you set a session to expire and one day and the session is not refreshed by a visit in one day then Monster wrecks it.  But wait, you need session data to persist for your users so it is available when they log back in? But you don't want to be tied to a specific user registration and authorization system? No problem. Sit down and we will have your permanent done in seconds! Permanent sessions that is! Unless of course you want curls! Just register a permanent unique id with a session and it won't get expired, deleted, destroyed and the Monster won't wreck shit associated with any permanent sessions! If you register permanent sessions, you are in charge of housekeeping and clean up. Hint, just remove the permanent unique id from the session record and it will get wrecked by the Monster. For example, register an email, userid, username or pretty much any unique id associated with some kind of profile or account from an external system. No fuss, no muss and you can either feather your hair or keep it curled, we don't care, just rock your permanents like a supastar!

That means this code could be horribly inefficient, ineffecitve, pointless, redundant and completely unsecure.  Or should that be insecure? I never get that one right. Insecure sounds like your code is afraid to approach a hot chick at a bar and you know that ain't true.  Unsecure sounds like you learned English in an Alabama public shool.   Either way, you have been warned!  Critiques and recommendations welcome.  No, I am not scottish, I just like sea monsters, so please stop asking.

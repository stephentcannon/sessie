    <h1 id="title">SESSIE</h1>
      <p>Sessie is a simple and weird persistent server side session management package for Meteor.<br />
      Sessie creates, validates and manages sessions.<br />
      Loch is where Sessie stores persistent session data when you feed her.<br />
      Ness stores and tracks Collection items associated with a session.<br />
      Monster destroys collection items associated with a session.<br />
      Yes, Sessie as in Nessie. Loch aka Lake for storage. Ness as in that Irish Princess to take care of you and watch your shit for you. Monster cuz he wrecks your shit.</p>
      Your session id is: {{sessionId}}<br />
      Your session key is: {{sessionKey}}<br />
      Your session expires on: {{sessionExpires}}<br />
      Your session expires in <b>{{sessionExpiry}}</b> days from your expiry date unless you visit again.<br />

        <h2 >The Sessie Session</h2>
        <div class="well">
          The Sessie session consists of a semi-permanent or absolutely permanent session including session ids, secret key ids, hmac SHA512 session keys based on the secret key and browser specific individuated data, session expiry configurable in days, key re-generation configurable in minutes, configurable session cookie names and automated session creation, and key validation and key generation. See example.js and sessie_config.js. Set it and forget it!

        <div class="well">
          Feed Sessie and she stores items in the Loch. Set a name value pair. Use a name to get a value. To update a value use the same name and set it. If the name already exists the value gets updated. If the name is new, then a new item is stored.  Delete items. See example.js and sessie_config.js.

          Add a Loch Item in the Feed Sessie Loch Items form. Use the get a Loch Item. Change the Loch Item through the Feed Sessie Loch Items form and watch. Do it a few times. Delete some items. Watch Sessie alter your items and add items. In this example implementation, Sessie will add and update items every 30 seconds to demonstrate server side control of session variables. See example.js for ways you could use Sessie.

        <div class="well">
          TODO Out of the box, Sessie has semi-permanent session lifetimes based on session configuration parameters you control. But wait, you need session data to persist for your users so it is available when they log back in? But you don't want to be tied to a specific user registration and authorization system? No problem. Sit down and we will have your permanent done in seconds! Permanent sessions that is! Unless of course you want curls! Just register a permanent unique id with a session and it won't get expired, deleted, destroyed and the Monster won't wreck shit associated with any permanent sessions! If you register permanent sessions, you are in charge of housekeeping and clean up. Hint, just remove the permanent unique id from the session record and it will get wrecked by the Monster. For example, register an email, userid, username or pretty much any unique id associated with some kind of profile or account from an external system. No fuss, no muss and you can either feather your hair or keep it curled, we don't care, just rock your permanents like a pro!

        <div class="well">
          Control all your session variable server side. In example.js the server has a timer that will randomly change values and add values to the client's session every 30 seconds. The example will not add more than 9 Loch items, but you can add as many elements as you like. This provides you with an example of how client sessions can be controlled server side. Imagine an administrative control panel to control the user experience, timed work flows, logic based work flows and anything else you might want to do.

          will this be an _extend or just calling Sessions.set
          what about testing tying reactivity on a subscription to Loch session variables and then changing them server side to show front end changes. Gotta test subscriptions server side? or maybe use observe?

Did you get it?  Cool, now you have awesome curly hair, but we actually meant a permanent session.  Go read that section again!  But, you may have told Ness to mark collection items as session objects but you don't want the Monster wrecking all of your data.  Simply mark those Ness session collection items as monster safe and the Monster won't go wrecking them when he cleans house.Kinda like Home Base!

        <h2>Caveat Emptor!</h2>
        <div class="well">This code is noobular. I have only been coding javascript since launch of <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor</a>. That means this code could be horribly inefficient, ineffecitve, pointless, redundant and completely unsecure.  Or should that be insecure? I never get that one right. Insecure sounds like your code is afraid to approach a hot chick at a bar and you know that ain't true.  Unsecure sounds like you learned English in an Alabama public shool.   Either way, you have been warned!  Critiques and recommendations welcome.  No, I am not scottish, stop asking.  Yes, some of the instructions are parody bcuz coding should be fun.  If you are offended by the humour, take a joke!
